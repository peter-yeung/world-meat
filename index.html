		    <h3 class="copy"><strong><em>Why bother?</em></strong> As with any progressive social movement, it’s difficult to inspire action when the results aren’t immediately apparent. But the consequences of eating meat – whether it be <strong>economic</strong>, <strong>environmental</strong>, <strong>biological</strong> or <strong>ethical</strong> – are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

Each has a vast water consumption (15,415 litres/kilo of beef) and considerable CO2 emissions (27 kg/kilo of beef). A kilo of lentils? <u>0.9</u> kg of CO2. Along with not flying and driving, going vegetarian is one of the best things you can do for the earth.

		<strong>“The biggest intervention</strong> people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints would not be to abandon cars, but to eat significantly less red meat,” says Professors Tim Benton of the University of Leeds. Between 1971 and 2010, worldwide production of meat tripled to around 600 billion kilograms as global population grew by 81%, meaning that we are eating a lot more meat than our grandparents.

       	<strong>Four-fifths</strong> of the deforestation across the Amazon rainforest could be linked to cattle ranching, according to a 2009 study. Agriculture itself is a significant driver of global warming, causing 15% of all emissions – half of which are from livestock. Glaciers are melting, lakes are drying up. The satellite imagery below, taken by the NASA earth observatory, provides just a glimpse of this impact.
